# Fractal Mathematics and Application

Fractals are self-repeating patterns found in nature that can be interpreted with
equations. It was first proposed by Dr. Beno√Æt Mandelbrot in 1975 and caused a lot
of stir in the scientific community. Although it was considered out rageous at the
time, many practical applications have been discovered.

Many of the electronic devices we use today would not have been possible if it
wasn't for it's discovery.

## Purpose

This is a school project, however it will be made in hope to make regular people want to
learn about this beautiful part of mathematics by use of great design.

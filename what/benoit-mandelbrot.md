Benoit B. Mandelbrot (20 November 1924 – 14 October 2010) was a Polish-born,
French and American mathematician, noted for developing a "theory of roughness"
in nature and the field of fractal geometry to help prove it, which included
coining the word "fractal". He later discovered the Mandelbrot set of intricate,
never-ending fractal shapes, named in his honor.

As a child, his family fled to France in 1936 to escape the growing Nazi persecution
of Jews. After World War II ended in 1945, Mandelbrot studied mathematics, graduating
from universities in Paris and the U.S., receiving a masters degree in aeronautics
from Caltech. He spent most of his career in both the U.S. and France, having dual
French and American citizenship. In 1958 he began working for IBM, where he stayed
for 35 years and was an IBM Fellow.

Because of his access to IBM's computers, Mandelbrot was one of the first to use
computer graphics to create and display fractal geometric images, leading to his
discovering the Mandelbrot set in 1979. In so doing, he was able to show how visual
complexity can be created from simple rules. He said that things typically considered
to be "rough", a "mess" or "chaotic", like clouds or shorelines, actually had a
"degree of order". His research career included contributions to fields including
geology, medicine, cosmology, engineering and the social sciences. Science writer
Arthur C. Clarke credits the Mandelbrot set as being "one of the most astonishing
discoveries in the entire history of mathematics".

Toward the end of his career, he was Sterling Professor of Mathematical Sciences
at Yale University, where he was the oldest professor in Yale's history to receive
tenure. Mandelbrot also held positions at the Pacific Northwest National
Laboratory, Université Lille Nord de France, Institute for Advanced Study and
Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique. During his career, he received over
15 honorary doctorates and served on many science journals, along with winning
numerous awards. His autobiography, The Fractalist, was published in 2012.

### <span id="2">Early Years</span>

Mandelbrot was born in Warsaw into a Jewish family from Lithuania. His family
had a strong academic tradition — his mother was a dental surgeon, although his
father made his living trading clothing. He was first introduced to mathematics
by two of his uncles, one of whom, Szolem Mandelbrojt, was a mathematician who
resided in Paris. "The love of his mind was mathematics," writes Mandelbrot, in
his autobiography.

Anticipating the threat posed by Nazi Germany, the family fled from Poland to
France in 1936 when he was 11. "The fact that my parents, as economic and political
refugees, joined Szolem in France saved our lives," he writes. Mandelbrot
attended the Lycée Rolin in Paris until the start of World War II, when his family
then moved to Tulle, France. He was helped by Rabbi David Feuerwerker, the Rabbi
of Brive-la-Gaillarde, to continue his studies. Much of France was occupied
by the Nazis at the time, and Mandelbrot recalls this period:

Our constant fear was that a sufficiently determined foe might report us to an
authority and we would be sent to our deaths. This happened to a close friend from
Paris, Zina Morhange, a physician in a nearby county seat. Simply to eliminate
the competition, another physician denounced her.... We escaped this fate. Who
knows why?

In 1944, Mandelbrot returned to Paris, studied at the Lycée du Parc in Lyon, and
in 1945 to 1947 attended the École Polytechnique, where he studied under Gaston
Julia and Paul Lévy. From 1947 to 1949 he studied at California Institute of
Technology, where he earned a master's degree in aeronautics. Returning to
France, he obtained his PhD degree in Mathematical Sciences at the University of
Paris in 1952.

### <span id="3">Research Career</span>

From 1949 to 1958, Mandelbrot was a staff member at the Centre National de la
Recherche Scientifique. During this time he spent a year at the Institute for
Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, where he was sponsored by John von Neumann.
In 1955 he married Aliette Kagan and moved to Geneva, Switzerland, and later to
the Université Lille Nord de France. In 1958 the couple moved to the United
States where Mandelbrot joined the research staff at the IBM Thomas J. Watson
Research Center in Yorktown Heights, New York. He remained at IBM for 35 years,
becoming an IBM Fellow, and later Fellow Emeritus.

From 1951 onward, Mandelbrot worked on problems and published papers not only in
mathematics but in applied fields such as information theory, economics, and fluid dynamics.

Mandelbrot found that price changes in financial markets did not follow a Gaussian
distribution, but rather Lévy stable distributions having theoretically infinite
variance. He found, for example, that cotton prices followed a Lévy stable
distribution with parameter α equal to 1.7 rather than 2 as in a Gaussian distribution.
"Stable" distributions have the property that the sum of many instances of a random
variable follows the same distribution but with a larger scale parameter.

As a visiting professor at Harvard University, Mandelbrot began to study fractals
called Julia sets that were invariant under certain transformations of the complex
plane. Building on previous work by Gaston Julia and Pierre Fatou, Mandelbrot used
a computer to plot images of the Julia sets. While investigating the topology of
these Julia sets, he studied the Mandelbrot set fractal that is now named after
him. In 1982, Mandelbrot expanded and updated his ideas in The Fractal Geometry
of Nature. This influential work brought fractals into the mainstream of
professional and popular mathematics, as well as silencing critics, who had
dismissed fractals as "program artifacts".

Mandelbrot left IBM in 1987, after 35 years and 12 days, when IBM decided to end
pure research in his division. He joined the Department of Mathematics at Yale,
and obtained his first tenured post in 1999, at the age of 75. At the time of his
retirement in 2005, he was Sterling Professor of Mathematical Sciences.

#### <span id="4">Developing "fractal geometry" and the Mandelbrot set</span>

In 1975, Mandelbrot coined the term fractal to describe these structures and first
published his ideas in 1975, and later translated, Fractals: Form, Chance and
Dimension. According to mathematics scientist Stephen Wolfram, the book was a
"breakthrough" for Mandelbrot, who until then would typically "apply fairly
straightforward mathematics ... to areas that had barely seen the light of serious
mathematics before." Wolfram adds that as a result of this new research, he was
no longer a "wandering scientist", and later called him "the father of fractals":

Mandelbrot ended up doing a great piece of science and identifying a much stronger
and more fundamental idea—put simply, that there are some geometric shapes, which
he called "fractals", that are equally "rough" at all scales. No matter how close
you look, they never get simpler, much as the section of a rocky coastline you
can see at your feet looks just as jagged as the stretch you can see from space.

Wolfram briefly describes fractals as a form of geometric repetition, "in which
smaller and smaller copies of a pattern are successively nested inside each other,
so that the same intricate shapes appear no matter how much you zoom in to the
whole. Fern leaves and Romanesco broccoli are two examples from nature." He points
out an unexpected conclusion:

One might have thought that such a simple and fundamental form of regularity would
have been studied for hundreds, if not thousands, of years. But it was not. In
fact, it rose to prominence only over the past 30 or so years—almost entirely
through the efforts of one man, the mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot.

Mandelbrot used the term "fractal" as it derived from the Latin word "fractus",
defined as broken or shattered glass. Using the newly developed IBM computers at
his disposal, Mandelbrot was able to create fractal images using graphic computer
code, images that an interviewer described as looking like "the delirious exuberance
of the 1960s psychedelic art with forms hauntingly reminiscent of nature and the
human body." He also saw himself as a "would-be Kepler", after the 17th-century
scientist Johannes Kepler, who calculated and described the orbits of the planets.

Mandelbrot, however, never felt he was inventing a new idea. He describes his
feelings in a documentary with science writer Arthur C. Clarke:

Exploring this set I certainly never had the feeling of invention. I never had
the feeling that my imagination was rich enough to invent all those extraordinary
things on discovering them. They were there, even though nobody had seen them
before. It's marvelous, a very simple formula explains all these very complicated
things. So the goal of science is starting with a mess, and explaining it with a
simple formula, a kind of dream of science.

According to Clarke, "the Mandelbrot set is indeed one of the most astonishing
discoveries in the entire history of mathematics. Who could have dreamed that such
an incredibly simple equation could have generated images of literally infinite
complexity?" Clarke also notes an "odd coincidence:" "the name Mandelbrot, and
the word "mandala"—for a religious symbol—which I'm sure is a pure coincidence,
but indeed the Mandelbrot set does seem to contain an enormous number of mandalas."

#### <span id="5">Fractals and the "theory of roughness"</span>

Mandelbrot created the first-ever "theory of roughness", and he saw "roughness"
in the shapes of mountains, coastlines and river basins; the structures of plants,
blood vessels and lungs; the clustering of galaxies. His personal quest was to
create some mathematical formula to measure the overall "roughness" of such objects
in nature. He began by asking himself various kinds of questions related to nature:

Can geometry deliver what the Greek root of its name [geo-] seemed to promise—truthful
measurement, not only of cultivated fields along the Nile River but also of untamed Earth?

Mandelbrot emphasized the use of fractals as realistic and useful models for
describing many "rough" phenomena in the real world. He concluded that "real
roughness is often fractal and can be measured." Although Mandelbrot
coined the term "fractal", some of the mathematical objects he presented in The
Fractal Geometry of Nature had been previously described by other mathematicians.
Before Mandelbrot, however, they were regarded as isolated curiosities with
unnatural and non-intuitive properties. Mandelbrot brought these objects together
for the first time and turned them into essential tools for the long-stalled
effort to extend the scope of science to explaining non-smooth, "rough" objects
in the real world. His methods of research were both old and new:

The form of geometry I increasingly favored is the oldest, most concrete, and most
inclusive, specifically empowered by the eye and helped by the hand and, today,
also by the computer ... bringing an element of unity to the worlds of knowing and
feeling ... and, unwittingly, as a bonus, for the purpose of creating beauty.

Fractals are also found in human pursuits, such as music, painting, architecture,
and stock market prices. Mandelbrot believed that fractals, far from being unnatural,
were in many ways more intuitive and natural than the artificially smooth objects
of traditional Euclidean geometry:

<blockquote>Clouds are not spheres, mountains are not cones, coastlines are not circles, and
bark is not smooth, nor does lightning travel in a straight line.</blockquote>

Mandelbrot has been called a visionary and a maverick. His informal and passionate
style of writing and his emphasis on visual and geometric intuition (supported by
the inclusion of numerous illustrations) made The Fractal Geometry of Nature
accessible to non-specialists. The book sparked widespread popular interest in
fractals and contributed to chaos theory and other fields of science and mathematics.

Mandelbrot also put his ideas to work in cosmology. He offered in 1974 a new
explanation of Olbers' paradox (the "dark night sky" riddle), demonstrating the
consequences of fractal theory as a sufficient, but not necessary, resolution of
the paradox. He postulated that if the stars in the universe were fractally
distributed (for example, like Cantor dust), it would not be necessary to rely
on the Big Bang theory to explain the paradox. His model would not rule out a Big
Bang, but would allow for a dark sky even if the Big Bang had not occurred.

### <span id="6">Awards and Honors</span>

Mandelbrot's awards include the Wolf Prize for Physics in 1993, the Lewis Fry
Richardson Prize of the European Geophysical Society in 2000, the Japan Prize in
2003, and the Einstein Lectureship of the American Mathematical Society in 2006.

The small asteroid 27500 Mandelbrot was named in his honor. In November 1990, he
was made a Knight in the French Legion of Honour. In December 2005, Mandelbrot
was appointed to the position of Battelle Fellow at the Pacific Northwest National
Laboratory. Mandelbrot was promoted to Officer of the Legion of Honour in January
2006. An honorary degree from Johns Hopkins University was bestowed on Mandelbrot
in the May 2010 commencement exercises

### <span id="7">Death and Legacy</span>

Mandelbrot died in a hospice in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on 14 October 2010 from
pancreatic cancer, at the age of 85. Reacting to news of his death, mathematician
Heinz-Otto Peitgen said "if we talk about impact inside mathematics, and applications
in the sciences, he is one of the most important figures of the last 50 years."

Lebanese author and professor Nassim Nicholas Taleb states that Mandelbrot "had
perhaps more cumulative influence than any other single scientist in history, with
the only close second, Isaac Newton." Taleb adds, "He was the only teacher I ever
had, the only person for whom I have had intellectual respect. But there was
something else that made him magnetic: he was a raconteur with a profound sense
of historical context...." James Gleick, author of the best-selling book, Chaos:
Making a New Science, explains further:

Benoit Mandelbrot was the one who let us appreciate chaos in all its glory—the
noisy, the wayward, and the freakish, from the very small to the very large. He
invented a new and slightly nebulous field of study—a kind of geometry, for want
of a better description—and he invented that recondite name for it, fractal.

Chris Anderson, curator of TED conferences, described Mandelbrot as "an icon who
changed how we see the world". The President of France at the time of Mandelbrot's
death, Nicolas Sarkozy, said Mandelbrot had "a powerful, original mind that never
shied away from innovating and shattering preconceived notions". Sarkozy also
added, "His work, developed entirely outside mainstream research, led to modern
information theory." Mandelbrot's obituary in The Economist points out his fame
as "celebrity beyond the academy" and lauds him as the "father of fractal geometry."

		<h2>Algorithm of the Universe.</h2>
		<p>A fractal is a mathematical set that has a fractal dimension that usually
			exceeds its topological dimension and may fall between the integers.
			Fractals are typically self-similar patterns, where self-similar means they
			are "the same from near as from far". Fractals may be exactly the same at
			every scale, or, as illustrated in Figure 1, they may be nearly the same at
			different scales. The definition of fractal goes beyond self-similarity per
			se to exclude trivial self-similarity and include the idea of a detailed
			pattern repeating itself.</p>
		<p>As mathematical equations, fractals are usually nowhere differentiable. An
			infinite fractal curve can be perceived of as winding through space differently
			from an ordinary line, still being a 1-dimensional line yet having a fractal
			dimension indicating it also resembles a surface.</p>
		<p>The mathematical roots of the idea of fractals have been traced through a
			formal path of published works, starting in the 17th century with notions of
			recursion, then moving through increasingly rigorous mathematical treatment
			of the concept to the study of continuous but not differentiable functions
			in the 19th century, and on to the coining of the word fractal in the 20th
			century with a subsequent burgeoning of interest in fractals and computer-based
			modelling in the 21st century. The term "fractal" was first used by mathematician
			Benoît Mandelbrot in 1975. Mandelbrot based it on the Latin frāctus meaning
			"broken" or "fractured", and used it to extend the concept of theoretical
			fractional dimensions to geometric patterns in nature.</p>
		<p>There is some disagreement amongst authorities about how the concept of a
			fractal should be formally defined. Mandelbrot himself summarized it as
			"beautiful, damn hard, increasingly useful, thats fractals." The general
			consensus is that theoretical fractals are infinitely self-similar, iterated,
			and detailed mathematical constructs having fractal dimensions, of which many
			examples have been formulated and studied in great depth. Fractals are not
			limited to geometric patterns, but can also describe processes in time.
			Fractal patterns with various degrees of self-similarity have been rendered
			or studied in images, structures and sounds and found in nature, technology,
			art, and law.</p>

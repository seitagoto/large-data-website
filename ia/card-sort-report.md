## Observations

There was not much questions being asked other than where the article, Fractal Flame
may belong to. William sorted the articles into 3 groups, then Emily later made 2
sub-divisions for Types of Fractals which was a pleasant surprise. They both organized
the cards in the way that's similar to my expectations.
